@Title Order

  @Bold "PureBasic" is a low-cost programming language. In buying PureBasic you will ensure that 
  development will go further and faster. For personal use (i.e.: not used by a commercial organization) 
  the updates are unlimited, unlike most other software out there. This means when you buy PureBasic 
  you will get all future updates for free, on the web site. Better still, you get the three versions 
  of PureBasic (MacOSX, Linux and Windows) for the same price! For ease of ordering, you can safely use our 
  secure online method. Thanks a lot for your support!
