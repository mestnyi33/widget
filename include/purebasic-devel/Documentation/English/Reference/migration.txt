@Title Migration guide

@Section Introduction
  PureBasic is a modern programming language which evolves quickly to follow technologic changes
  and brings up-to-date commandset to the programmer. It sometimes involves to change or redesign
  some part of the language. While we try to keep these breaking changes to a minimum, it can happen
  and this migration guide will help to update your source from one version to another.

  If you need stability instead of cutting edge features, we highly recommend to stick to 'LTS'
  (Long Term Support) version of PureBasic, which are released every 2 years, and are actively
  maintained for bug fixes.
