@Title Pseudotypes

@Description

  For advanced programmers. The pseudotypes are a way to ease the programming when dealing with
  external libraries which need datatypes that are not internally supported by PureBasic. In this
  case, it is possible to use the predefined pseudotype which will do the appropriate conversion
  on the fly, without extra work. As they are not 'real' types, the chosen naming scheme is explicitly
  different: a 'p-' prefix (for 'pseudo') is part of the type name. The available pseudotypes are:
@FixedFont
  p-ascii: acts as a string type, but will always convert the string to ascii before
           calling the function, even when the program is compiled in @ReferenceLink "unicode" "unicode" mode. 
           It is very useful when accessing a shared library which doesn't have unicode 
           support in an unicode program for example.
           
  p-utf8: acts as a string type, but will always convert the string to utf8 before calling the
          function. It is very useful when accessing a shared library which needs its @ReferenceLink "unicode" "unicode"
          string be passed as UTF8 instead of ascii or unicode strings.

  p-bstr: acts as a string type, but will always convert the string to bstr before calling the
          function. It is very useful when accessing a shared library which needs bstr parameters,
          like COM components.

  p-unicode: acts as a string type, but will always convert the string to @ReferenceLink "unicode" "unicode" before
             calling the function, even when the program is compiled in ascii mode. 
             It is very useful when accessing a shared library which only supports unicode
             in an ascii program for example.

  p-variant: acts as a numeric type, will adjust the function call to use the variant parameter
             correctly. It is very useful when accessing a shared library which needs 'variant' parameters,
             like COM components.

  The pseudotypes can only be used with @ReferenceLink "prototypes" "prototypes", @ReferenceLink "interfaces" "interfaces"
  and @ReferenceLink "import_endimport" "imported" functions. The pseudotypes does the appropriate
  conversion only if it is necessary.
  
@Example 

@Code
  Import "User32.lib"
   
    ; We use the 'p-ascii' pseudotype for the string parameters, as
    ; MessageBoxA() is an ASCII only function. The compiler will 
    ; automatically converts the strings to ASCII when needed.
    ;
    MessageBoxA(Window.i, Body.p-ascii, Title.p-ascii, Flags.i = 0)
                                                  
  EndImport
  
  ; It will work correctly even if the internal PureBasic strings are in unicode
  ; because the compiler will take care of the ASCII conversion automatically.
  ;
  MessageBoxA(0, "Hello", "World")
    
@EndCode
