@Title UserGuide - Loops

Data, Events or many other things can also be processed using loops, which are always
checked for a specific condition. Loops can be: @ReferenceLink "repeat_until" "Repeat : Until",
@ReferenceLink "repeat_until" "Repeat : Forever", @ReferenceLink "while_wend" "While : Wend",
@ReferenceLink "for_next" "For : Next", @ReferenceLink "foreach_next" "ForEach : Next".

In this loop the counter A is increased by two each time, this loop will always perform
the same number of iterations.
@Code
  Define.i A
  For A = 0 To 10 Step 2
    Debug A
  Next A
@EndCode

This loop will increment the variable B by a @Link "math/random" "random" amount between 0 and 20 each time,
until B exceeds 100. The number of iterations actually performed in the loop will vary
depending on the random numbers. The check is performed at the start of the loop - so
if the condition is already true, zero iterations may be performed. Take the ; away
from the second line to see this happen.
@Code
  Define.i B
  ; B = 100
  While B < 100
    B + Random(20)
    Debug B
  Wend
@EndCode

This loop is very similar to the last except that the check is performed at the end
of the loop. So one iteration, at least, will be performed. Again remove the ; from
the second line to demonstrate.
@Code
  Define.i C
  ; C = 100
  Repeat
    C + Random(20)
    Debug C
  Until C > 99
@EndCode


This loop is infinite. It won't stop until you stop it (use the red X button on the
IDE toolbar).
@Code
  Define.i D
  Repeat
    Debug D
  Forever
@EndCode


There is a special loop for working with @ReferenceLink "newlist" "lists" and
@ReferenceLink "newmap" "maps", it will iterate every member of the list (or map) in turn.
@Code
  NewList Fruit.s()
  
  AddElement(Fruit())
  Fruit() = "Banana"
  
  AddElement(Fruit())
  Fruit() = "Apple"
  
  AddElement(Fruit())
  Fruit() = "Pear"
  
  AddElement(Fruit())
  Fruit() = "Orange"
  
  ForEach Fruit()
    Debug Fruit()
  Next Fruit()
@EndCode
