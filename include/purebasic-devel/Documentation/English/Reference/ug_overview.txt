The following topics in this chapter should give you some ideas, where to start with
PureBasic. It shouldn't replace any larger tutorial or the massive information,
which can be found on the popular @ReferenceLink "links" "PureBasic forums". So the following information
texts are short, but they include some "keywords" and links to further information,
which are included in this reference manual. This chapter covers only a small part
of the 1500+ commands available in PureBasic!
