@Title Introduction

  SpiderBasic is an "high-level" programming language based on established "BASIC" rules. 
  It does share background with other "BASIC" compiler, but has its own syntax extensions. 
  Learning SpiderBasic is very easy! SpiderBasic has been created for beginners and experts alike. 
  Compilation time is extremely fast. We have put a lot of effort into its realization to produce
