@Title Data

@Section Introduction

  SpiderBasic allows the use of @Keyword Data, to store predefined blocks of information inside of your program. 
  This is very useful for default values of a program (language string for example) or, in a game, to 
  define the sprite way to follow (precalculated). 
  @LineBreak
  @LineBreak
  @Keyword DataSection must be called first to indicate a data section follow. This means all labels 
  and data component will be stored in the @Keyword data section of the program, which has a much faster access 
  than the code section. @Keyword Data will be used to enter the data. @Keyword EndDataSection must be specified if some 
  code follows the data declaration. One of good stuff is you can define different @Keyword Data sections in the 
  code without any problem. @Keyword Restore and @Keyword Read command will be used to retrieve the data.
    
@Section Commands

@Syntax

  @Keyword DataSection

@Description

  Start a data section. 


@Syntax

  @Keyword EndDataSection

@Description

  End a data section. 


@Syntax

  @Keyword Data.TypeName

@Description
  
  Defines data. The type can only be a native @ReferenceLink "variables" "basic type" (integer, long, word, byte, ascii, unicode, float, double, quad, character, string). Any 
  number of data can be put on the same line, each one delimited with a comma ','. 
    
@Example

@Code
  Data.l 100, 200, -250, -452, 145
  Data.s "Hello", "This", "is ", "What ?"
@EndCode


@Syntax

  @Keyword Restore label

@Description

  This keyword is useful to set the start indicator for the @Keyword "Read" to a specified label. All labels used
  for this purpose should be placed within the @Keyword "DataSection" because the data is treated as a separate
  block from the program code when it is compiled and may become disassociated from a label if the label
  were placed outside of the DataSection.
  
@Example

@Code
  Restore StringData
  Read.s MyFirstData$
  Read.s MySecondData$
  
  Restore NumericalData
  Read.l a
  Read.l b

  Debug MyFirstData$
  Debug a
  
  DataSection
    NumericalData:    
      Data.l 100, 200, -250, -452, 145
      
    StringData:
      Data.s "Hello", "This", "is ", "What ?"
  EndDataSection
@EndCode

@Syntax

  @Keyword Read[.<type>] <variable>
  
@Description

  Read the next available data. The next available data can be changed by using the @Keyword Restore command. 
  By default, the next available data is the first data declared. The type of data to read is determined by the
  type suffix. The @ReferenceLink "define" "default type" will be used if it is not specified.
