@Title Getting Help

  The SpiderBasic IDE provides ways to access the SpiderBasic help-file, as well as other files
  and documentation you want to view while programming.

@Section Quick access to the reference guide

  By pressing the help shortcut (F1 by default) or selecting the "Help..." command from the Help
  menu while the mouse cursor is over a SpiderBasic keyword or function, the help will be opened
  directly at the description of that keyword or function.

  If the word at the cursor position has no help entry, the main reference page will be displayed.

  The reference manual can also be viewed side by side with the source code using the
  @ReferenceLink "ide_tools" "Help Tool".

@Section Accessing external helpfiles from the IDE

  If you have other helpfiles you wish to be able to access from the IDE, then create a "Help" subdirectory in your SpiderBasic
  folder and copy them to it. These files will appear in the "External Help" submenu of the Help menu, and in the
  popupmenu you get when right-clicking in the editing area.

@OS Windows
  Chm and Hlp files will be displayed in the MS help viewer.
@EndOS

  The IDE will open the helpfiles in the internal fileviewer. So files like text files can be viewed directly like this.
  For other types, you can use the @referencelink ide_externaltools "Config Tools" menu to configure an external tool to
  handle the type of help-file you use. The help will then be displayed in that tool.

  For example, if you have pdf helpfiles, configure an external tool to handle pdf files and put the files in the Help
  subdirectory of SpiderBasic. Now if you click the file in the "external help" menu, it will be opened in that external tool.
