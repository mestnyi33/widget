@Title Includes Functions

@Syntax

  @Keyword IncludeFile  "Filename" 
  
@Description

  @Keyword IncludeFile will always include the specified source file, at the current place in the code
  (even if @Keyword XIncludeFile has been called for this file before).
  
  @Example

@Code
  IncludeFile "Sources\myfile.sb" ; This file will be inserted in the current code.
@EndCode

  This command is useful, if you want to split your source code into several files, to be able 
  to reuse parts e.g. in different projects.

@Syntax

  @Keyword XIncludeFile "Filename"
  
@Description

  @Keyword XIncludeFile is similar to @Keyword IncludeFile excepts it avoids to include the same file twice.

  @Example

@Code
  XIncludeFile "Sources\myfile.sb" ; This file will be inserted.
  XIncludeFile "Sources\myfile.sb" ; This file will be ignored along with all subsequent calls. 
@EndCode

  This command is useful, if you want to split your source code into several files, to be able 
  to reuse parts e.g. in different projects.

@Syntax

  @Keyword IncludePath "path" 

@Description

  @Keyword IncludePath will specify a default path for all files included after the call of 
  this command. This can be very handy when you include many files which are in the same directory.

  @Example

@Code
  IncludePath  "Sources\Data"
  IncludeFile  "Sprite.sb"
  XIncludeFile "Music.sb"
@EndCode
