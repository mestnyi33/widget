@Title Runtime

@Syntax

  @Keyword Runtime Variable
  @Keyword Runtime #Constant
  @Keyword Runtime Procedure() declaration
  @Keyword Runtime Enumeration declaration
  
@Description

  For advanced programmers. @Keyword Runtime is used to create runtime accessible list of programming objects like variables,
  constants and procedures. Once compiled a program doesn't have variable, constant or procedure label anymore as everything is
  converted into binary code. @Keyword Runtime enforces the compiler to add an extra reference for a specific object to
  have it available through the @LibraryLink "Runtime" "Runtime" library. The objects can be manipulated using their string
  reference, even when the program is compiled.

  Another use would be adding a small realtime scripting language to the program, allowing easy modification of exposed
  variables, using runtime constants values. While it could be done manually by building a map of objects, the @Keyword Runtime
  keyword allows to do it in a standard and unified way.

  @Example Procedure

@Code
  Runtime Procedure OnEvent()
    Debug "OnEvent"
  EndProcedure 

  Debug GetRuntimeInteger("OnEvent()") ; Will display the procedure address
@EndCode

  @Example Enumeration
  
@Code  
  Runtime Enumeration
    #Constant1 = 10
    #Constant2
    #Constant3
  EndEnumeration

  Debug GetRuntimeInteger("#Constant1")
  Debug GetRuntimeInteger("#Constant2")
  Debug GetRuntimeInteger("#Constant3")
@EndCode

  @Example Variable
  
@Code  
  Define a = 20
  Runtime a

  Debug GetRuntimeInteger("a")
  SetRuntimeInteger("a", 30)
  
  Debug a ; the variable has been modified
@EndCode
