@Title Using several SpiderBasic versions on Windows

@Section Overview

  It is possible to install several SpiderBasic versions on your hard disk at the same time.
  This is useful to finish one project with an older SpiderBasic version, and
  start developing a new project with a new SpiderBasic version.

@Section How to do it

  Create different folders like "SpiderBasic_1.00" and "SpiderBasic_1.10" and install the related
  SpiderBasic version in each folders.
@LineBreak
@LineBreak
  When one "SpiderBasic.exe" is started, it will assign all ".sb" files 
  with this version of SpiderBasic. So when a source code is loaded by double-clicking 
  on the related file, the currently assigned SpiderBasic version will be started.
  Beside SpiderBasic will change nothing, which can affect other SpiderBasic versions in different
  folders.

@LineBreak
  To avoid the automatic assignment of ".sb" files when starting the IDE, a
  shortcut can be created from SpiderBasic.exe with "/NOEXT" as parameter. The command line
  options for the IDE are described @ReferenceLink "ide_commandline" "here".
@LineBreak
@LineBreak
  @Bold "Note:" The settings for the IDE are saved in the %APPDATA%\SpiderBasic directory. To keep the multiple versions from using
  the same configuration files, the /P /T and /A @ReferenceLink "ide_commandline" "switches" can be used. Furthermore there is the /PORTABLE
  switch which puts all files back into the SpiderBasic directory and disabled the creation of the .sb extension.
