@Title SpiderBasic objects

@Section Introduction

  The purpose of this section is to describe the behavior, creation, and handling of 
  objects in SpiderBasic. For the demonstration, we will use the @LibraryLink Image Image object, but the 
  same logic applies to all other SpiderBasic objects. When creating an Image object, we 
  can do it in two ways: indexed and dynamic. 

@Section I. Indexed numbering

  The static, indexed way, allows you to reference an object by a predefined 
  numeric value. The first available index number is 0 and subsequent indexes 
  are allocated sequentially. This means that if you use the number 0 and then 
  the number 1000, 1001 indexes will be allocated and 999 (from 1 to 999) will 
  be unused, which is not an efficient way to use indexed objects. If you need a 
  more flexible method, use the dynamic way of allocating objects, as described 
  in section II. The indexed way offers several advantages:
  @Indent @Section
    - Easier handling, since no @ReferenceLink "Variables" variables or @ReferenceLink "Dim" arrays are required. @LineBreak
    - 'Group' processing, without the need to use an intermediate array. @LineBreak
    - Use the object in @ReferenceLink "Procedures" procedures without declaring anything in @ReferenceLink "Global" global (if using a @ReferenceLink "General_Rules" constant or a number). @LineBreak
    - An object that is associated with an index is automatically freed when reusing that index.
  @EndIndent

  The maximum index number is limited to an upper bound, depending of the object 
  type (usually from 5000 to 60000). @ReferenceLink "Enumerations" Enumerations are strongly recommended if 
  you plan to use sequential constants to identify your objects (which is also 
  recommended).

  @Example

@Code
  CreateImage(0, 640, 480) ; Create an image, the n°0
  ResizeImage(0, 320, 240) ; Resize the n°0 image
@EndCode  

  @Example

@Code
  CreateImage(2, 640, 480) ; Create an image, the n°2
  ResizeImage(2, 320, 240) ; Resize the n°2 image
  CreateImage(2, 800, 800) ; Create a new image in the n°2 index, the old one is automatically free'ed
@EndCode

  @Example

@Code
  For k = 0 To 9
    CreateImage(k, 640, 480) ; Create 10 different images, numbered from 0 to 9
    ResizeImage(k, 320, 240) ; Create a new image in the n°2 index, the old one is automatically free'ed
  Next
@EndCode  

  @Example

@Code
  #ImageBackground = 0
  #ImageButton     = 1

  CreateImage(#ImageBackground, 640, 480) ; Create an image (n°0)
  ResizeImage(#ImageBackground, 320, 240) ; Resize the background image
  CreateImage(#ImageButton    , 800, 800) ; Create an image (n°1)
@EndCode  

@Section II. Dynamic numbering

  Sometimes, indexed numbering isn't very handy to handle dynamic situations where we need 
  to deal with an unknown number of objects. SpiderBasic provides an easy and complementary way 
  to create objects in a dynamic manner. Both methods (indexed and dynamic) can be used together 
  at the same time without any conflict. To create a dynamic object, you just have to specify 
  the @#PB_Any constant instead of the indexed number, and the dynamic number will be returned as 
  result of the function. Then just use this number with the other object functions in the place 
  where you would use an indexed number (except to create a new object). This way of object handling can be very useful when used 
  in combination with a @LibraryLink "List" "list", which is also a dynamic way of storage.

  @Indent
  @Example

@Code
  DynamicImage1 = CreateImage(#PB_Any, 640, 480) ; Create a dynamic image
  ResizeImage(DynamicImage1, 320, 240) ; Resize the DynamicImage1
@EndCode  

@EndIndent 

@Section Overview of the different SpiderBasic objects

  Different SpiderBasic objects (windows, gadgets, sprites, etc.) can use the same range of object numbers
  again. So the following objects can be enumerated each one starting at 0 (or other value) and SpiderBasic
  differs them by their type:
  @Indent
  - @LibraryLink "font" "Font" @LineBreak
  - @LibraryLink "gadget" "Gadget" @LineBreak
  - @LibraryLink "json" "JSON" @LineBreak
  - @LibraryLink "image" "Image" @LineBreak
  - @LibraryLink "menu" "Menu" (not @@MenuItem, as this is no object) @LineBreak
  - @LibraryLink "regularexpression" "RegularExpression" @LineBreak
  - @LibraryLink "sound" "Sound" @LineBreak
  - @LibraryLink "sprite" "Sprite" @LineBreak
  - @LibraryLink "toolbar" "ToolBar" @LineBreak
  - @LibraryLink "window" "Window" @LineBreak
  - @LibraryLink "xml" "XML" @LineBreak
  @EndIndent
