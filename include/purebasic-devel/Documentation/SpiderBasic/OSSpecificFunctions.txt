;      List of SpiderBasic commands that are not fully cross-platform
;
; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
; 
; This file is used to automatically generate @SupportedOS tags for the help, 
; and for any other purpose where such a list might be useful.
; Keep the syntax strict, as it is automatically parsed.
;
; This file lists ONLY commands which do not work on all OS. Any command not listed
; here will be marked as supported by all OS.
;
; File syntax:
; - Empty lines and ";" lines are ignored
; - Whitespace and case are ignored (also for function names to reduce errors)
;
; #Library: <Name>
;   Specify the name of the library where the next functions are in.
;   
; A function entry looks like one of these:
;   <functionname> : <os tags>
;   <functionname> : <os tags> - <comment>
;
; <os tags> can be one of these separated by ",": 
;   iOS
;   Android
;
;   If a new tag is added, please document its use here.
;
;   If such a tag is present, it means the function works on this OS. If the tag is present in brackets, like "(Windows)",
;   it means that the command exists only as a dummy function, so it compiles but does nothing. If a tag is not present at all,
;   it means that the command is entirely missing on that OS.
;
;   The dummy tags will be ignored for the manual, but they might be useful for other purposes.
;   (for example to do a tool to advise on platform problems)
;   
; <comment> can be a short comment about platform compatibility of this command. Something like
;   "Only has a meaning on Windows" or similar may be helpful. (also ignored for the manual)
;
;
; Special grouping tag (for entire libraries etc):
; #StartGroup: <os tags> - <comment>
;   <function list>
; #EndGroup
;
;   Applies <os tags> and the optional <comment> to all commands in the list.
;   Useful when entire libraries have the same tags and comments.
;   The function list is one function per line (empty lines, comments and #Library lines are allowed)
;
;
; Example: (indicates that the command is supported on Windows and has a dummy on Linux and MacOS, with a comment about that)
;   #Library: Window
;   SmartWindowRefresh: Windows, (Linux), (MacOS) - Only has an effect on Windows
;
; Group Example:
;   #StartGroup: Windows, Linux - 3DEngine not supported on MacOS
;     #Library: Engine3D
;     Add3DArchive
;     AmbientColor
;     ...
;   #StopGroup
