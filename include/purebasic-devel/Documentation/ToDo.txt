Just a file to make statements about things to do...
So every PureBasic SVN team member can see what are the next things
on a shared place.

-------------------
NEW! The ToDo list is now public - see here:
    http://www.purebasic.fr/english/viewtopic.php?t=38856
                   ----------------------------------------------------


Docs::Manual  (always valid for english version, other languages are independent)
-------------

- following examples are linked in the docs, but not available: Gadget3D.pb, Node.pb, Sound3D.pb, Window3D.pb
- OpenDatabaseRequester(): description of optional parameter [, Plugin] is missing in the docs
- Process lib: adding Source example
- 3D engine:   source example, showing stuff like collision, etc.

- EventLParam() / EventWParam() : users are requesting manual descriptions for them, because they are 
                                  included since PB 2.4 but still not officially supported...
- Math lib:    currently there is noted in the Overview, that mostly .f floats are supported. Either
               Doubles should also be supported by PB or a note about this (and correct type converting) 
               must be added.
- Unicode example - there should be one in Examples directory, as many users are requesting this.
- 8192x8192 restriction for images was removed?  => then the docs must be updated
- Terrain lib: the generating of real-time-shadows on terrains isn't supported by PB now. A note should be
               added to the manual - or will this be fixed within a short time?
- Goto: more "warnings" at related keywords (Select...), that it shouldn't be used because of stack problems (see here: http://www.purebasic.fr/english/viewtopic.php?t=28136)
- Add3DArchive(): documentation about the return value is missing  (adding archive successful or not?)
- WaitWindowEvent(): a note about the default value (number or PB constant) of the optional 'TimeOut' parameter is missing
- Fog/SkyDome (and probably other 3D commands too): more informations about parameter type and possible ranges are required (see here: http://www.purebasic.fr/german/viewtopic.php?p=216946#216946)
- 3D libs: include "#PB_Compiler_Home +" in every example code to make them runnable!? (see here: http://www.purebasic.fr/german/viewtopic.php?p=216951#216951)
- Node.pb example is missing
- 'Compile executable' is completely missing in the IDE_Compiler.txt doc - e.g. there should
   be added a note, that on MacOS ".app" must be added to the executable name to make it run
   stand-alone
- #PB_Integer constant is not mentioned in the docs
- Scintilla.txt: example and screenshot are missing in the docs
- Library Subsystems: DirectX 7 need to mentioned with PB4.40!



Important! Please check also the change log (Readme.html) by fr34k for new/changed stuff 
before creating the PB v4 final!  ;)

Also be aware of notes about improving the manual by german users here:
  http://www.purebasic.fr/german/viewtopic.php?t=7908  (old)
  http://www.purebasic.fr/german/viewtopic.php?t=12957
  http://www.purebasic.fr/german/viewtopic.php?t=12958



DocMaker
--------
Must be updated to include the new keywords (highlighting and reference in the .chm index)

Probably also include the general chapters of the reference to the 'Index', so that Unicode
and other chapters can be easily found.

** Note: most things are already done now. The reference and chm-content maybe needs a better
         structure. For discussion see mentioned thread above on german board.

Sources::Manual
----------------
All source examples should be checked, if all commands of a library
are used in the source.

Source examples should be extended for:
  - all 3D libraries (a lot of commands are never used in official examples)
  - Process lib
  - 3D sprite lib
  - more to follow...


Topics done  (move to this chapter please)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- OpenWindow(): check all examples using OpenWindow() for needed title$ + flags switch
- Unicode:     an extra chapter describing the 'Basics' of Unicode and the
               differences of compiling Ascii and Unicode programs, links to
               needed IDE and Compiler settings as well
- Window lib:  SmartWindowRefresh - description + example needed
- WriteData(): example isn't working anymore -> problem with PeekS() and WriteData()?
- CompilerDirectives: support for #PB_OS_MacOS constant (in compiler+residents too?)
- Reference / Links section must be updated too
- IsThread():  completely missing in manual
- Enable/DisableExplicit:  description is included in CompilerDirectives.txt, but links in the CHM index are missing
- NewList/Dim (+ related stuff at LinkedLists and Arrays):
               currently there is sometimes described the old modus "always Global",
               docs must be updated to the new way of working
- Subsystems:  missing doc in Reference manual (linked from Compilerfunctions.txt)
- OnErrorExit(): missing description added to the OnError lib
- CreatePopupMenu(): updated example like suggested here: http://www.purebasic.fr/german/viewtopic.php?t=7338&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=10
                     (would be a change from using MenuTitle() to OpenSubMenu() - its a matter of view....  please Fred of fr34k decide)
- CatchImage(): the length parameter is always needed when using compressed image formats, see here:
                http://www.purebasic.fr/german/viewtopic.php?t=7338&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=30
                (seems also be true with CatchSound() and ogg sounds)
- OpenHelp(): Flags parameter is missing in the manual
- MakeIPAddress(): current help contains as description MakeIPAddress(Field0, Field1, Field2, Field3), but
                   short help in the IDE statusbar shows MakeIPAddress(Field4,Field3,Field2,Field1). What is right?
- CreateThread(): docs must be updated to reflect latest changes with PB 4.01 (it doesn't return the OS handle anymore...)
- AddSysTrayIcon(): description of the return value is missing
- RotateEntity(): uses now absolute angles??  (see here: http://www.purebasic.fr/english/viewtopic.php?t=28150)
- ArraySize(): pressing F1 in the source doesn't display the related help, also not included in the index of 
               .chm file => seems to be missing in IDE/DocMaker
